# CppCheck-XML-to-HTML-Conversion
Python script and an xlst transformer for creating enhanced report from CppCheck

## Instructions
On cppcheck you can get the output file also in XML format but HTML format is a bit tricky. As an alternative I developed a simple Python script to convert XML to HTML by using a transformer. 

- Regarding the XML output creation, see this pdf in the link: https://cppcheck.sourceforge.io/manual.pdf

Enter the directory paths requested in the Python script and check the HTML result.

This is how the report looks. The line numbers are linked to vscode lines properly.
